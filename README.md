## 📊 Project Phases

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- ✅ Cleaned missing and inconsistent values
- ✅ Converted currencies and percentages
- ✅ Handled data types and column formatting
- ✅ Removed redundant and null-heavy columns
- ✅ Exported cleaned dataset for further analysis

### 2. Data Visualization (Next)
- 📈 Univariate and bivariate visualizations
- 📍 Price trends by room type, location, and superhost status
- 🔥 Correlation heatmaps for numeric features

### 3. Modeling (Upcoming)
- 🔢 Feature engineering
- 🧠 Machine learning model for price prediction
- 📊 Model performance evaluation
