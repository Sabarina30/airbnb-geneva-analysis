Exploratory Data Analysis and Price Modeling for Airbnb listings in Geneva
# 🏡 Airbnb Geneva Data Analysis & Price Exploration

This project explores and analyzes Airbnb listing data from **Geneva, Switzerland** with the goal of understanding key factors influencing listing prices. This includes **data cleaning**, **visualization**, and setting the foundation for future **predictive modeling**.

## 📊 Project Phases

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- ✅ Cleaned missing and inconsistent values
- ✅ Converted currencies and percentages
- ✅ Handled data types and column formatting
- ✅ Removed redundant and null-heavy columns
- ✅ Exported cleaned dataset for further analysis

## 📊 Phase 2: Data Visualization
- Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analyses performed using seaborn and matplotlib.
- Outlier analysis on price
- Visual insights from room type, superhost status, neighbourhoods, etc.
- Correlation matrix and pairplot of top numerical features.

### 3. Modeling (Upcoming)
- 🔢 Feature engineering
- 🧠 Machine learning model for price prediction
- 📊 Model performance evaluation
